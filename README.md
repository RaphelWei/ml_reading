# 📚 Paper Reading Notes

I use GitHub Issues to take structured notes while reading papers. Each issue captures key insights, problem summaries, and follow-up ideas.

You’re welcome to use my template:  
[📄 paper_review.yml](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/paper_review.yml)

To use it, copy the file to your repo under `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`.
